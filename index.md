# Silvio Traversaro
I am a robotics and software engineer. I currently am a "Technologist" (rought translation: Applied Scientist) in the at A the Italian Institute of Technology, where I collaborate with theiCub Tech Facility group and where I coordinate the joint lab between the Italian Institute of Technology and Danieli Automation.

## Field of work and research

My field of research is the in estimation, control and motion planning of robots, in particular force-controlled humanoids. In my work I tackle the scientific and technological challenges that prevent robots to physically interact naturally with the surrounding environment and with humans.

Since 2013 I was deeply involved with the development and maintenance of the iCub humanoid robot, gaining a multidisciplinary experience by interacting with fields such as mechanical engineering, embedded programming and machine learning.

I mantain several open source tools used in my work at the IIT, including the robot dynamics C++ library iDynTree, the set of plugins for the Gazebo simulator gazebo-yarp-plugins and the CMake-based distribution of IIT software robotology-superbuild.
